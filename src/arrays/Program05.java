/**
 * Write a program to accept name and total marks of N number of students 
 * in two single subscript arrays name[ ] and totalmarks[ ].
 * Calculate and print:
 * (i) The average of the total marks obtained by N number of students.
 * [average = (sum of total marks of all the students)/N]
 * (ii) Deviation of each student's total marks with the average.
 * [deviation = total marks of a student - average]
