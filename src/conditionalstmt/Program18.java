/**
 * The equivalent resistance of series and parallel connections of two resistances are given by the formula:
 * (a) R1 = r1 + r2 (Series)
 * (b) R2 = (r1 * r2) / (r1 + r2) (parallel)
 * 
 * Using a switch case statement, 
 * write a program to enter the value of r1 and r2 
 * * Calculate and display the equivalent resistances accordingly
